# ðŸ“„ Project Documentation: End-to-End Self-Driving Car Simulation

## 1. Project Title
DeepDrive: End-to-End Autonomous Driving in a Simulated Environment

## 2. Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end deep learning approach to autonomous driving by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that predicts steering angles directly from camera images.

* The system learns driving behavior without manual feature engineering and operates within a simulation environment (e.g., Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator or CARLA).
* The goal is to show how modern self-driving car systems can use computer vision and deep learning to make driving decisions.

## 3. What's New / Highlights
* **End-to-End Pipeline:** Raw images to steering commands â€” no manual lane detection or traditional CV techniques.
* **Data Augmentation:** Improves model robustness (e.g., brightness shifts, flips, camera angle offsets).
* **Behavioral Cloning:** Mimics human driving behaviors by learning from recorded expert demonstrations.
* **Model Interpretability:** Saliency maps and activation visualizations show what the model "sees."
* **Optional Extension:** Reinforcement Learning (DQN/Policy Gradients) for driving without imitation.

CNN Model Architecture:
(Adapted from Nvidiaâ€™s End-to-End Self-Driving Paper)

* **Input:** 3-channel RGB images (cropped and resized)
* **5 Convolutional Layers:**
    * (24 filters, 5x5 kernel, stride 2)
    * (36 filters, 5x5 kernel, stride 2)
    * (48 filters, 5x5 kernel, stride 2)
    * (64 filters, 3x3 kernel)
    * (64 filters, 3x3 kernel)
* Flatten
* **3 Fully Connected Layers:**
    * (100 â†’ 50 â†’ 10 â†’ 1 output: Steering Angle)

## 6. Data Collection and Preprocessing
* **Data Source:**
    * Record your own driving inside the simulator (center, left, right camera views + steering angle).
* **Preprocessing Steps:**
    * Crop irrelevant parts (sky, dashboard)
    * Normalize pixel values (between -1 and 1)
    * Resize to a smaller input shape (e.g., 66x200)
* **Data Augmentation:**
    * Random brightness change
    * Random shadow addition
    * Horizontal flipping (invert steering)
    * Slight shifts in width and height
    * Adjust steering for side cameras

## 7. Training Strategy
* **Loss function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) (between predicted and actual steering angle)
* **Optimizer:** Adam (with tuned learning rate, e.g., 1e-4)
* **Batch Size:** 32â€“64
* Early stopping and checkpointing to avoid overfitting
* Model trained for behavior cloning (learning from a human driver)

## 8. Evaluation Metrics
* Training and Validation Loss Curves
* **On-road performance in the simulator:**
    * No lane departures
    * Smooth steering without jerky motions
    * Recovery from small mistakes (by using side camera data)
* **Optional Metrics:**
    * Time without human intervention
    * Average deviation from the center of the lane

| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overfitting on Training Data      | Data augmentation, dropout layers                              |
| Poor Generalization on Curves     | Include more sharp turns and recovery data                     |
| Model drifting over time          | Train on side camera images with corrected steering angles     |

* Obstacle Detection using Object Detection Models (YOLOv8)
* Multi-task Learning (predict steering + throttle + brake)
* Deploy on a real RC car (NVIDIA Jetson Nano + Raspberry Pi)
